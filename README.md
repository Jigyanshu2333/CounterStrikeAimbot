# CounterStrikeAimbot
This project is based on the game Counter Strike: Condition Zero. It creates an aimbot which can detect for a bot in the game and can aim on the bot.
The project is based on the specifications of my laptop and the variables may change depending on the window size of the laptop and the version of the game. You can try redefining x and y for accurate results.
This project is quite slow and needs some updations but is quite accurate in detecting enemies and attack on them.
